### 3. How to Upload the Code (Crucial Step)
You cannot just upload the text you gave me as a `.txt` file. You need to upload the **Jupyter Notebook**.

1.  **Open your Jupyter Notebook** on your computer.
2.  **Delete the top cells** that say "Student ID" and "Word Count."
3.  **Rename the file:** Change it from `Assignment_Final.ipynb` to `Coffee_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`.
4.  **Save the file.**
5.  **Upload to GitHub:**
    *   Upload the `.ipynb` file.
    *   Upload the `Coffee Shop Sales.csv` (if it's not too big, otherwise just leave the link in the README).

### 4. Special Tip for "Geographic Data Scientist"
Since you want a Geographic role, but this dataset doesn't have map coordinates (lat/long), you need to emphasize the **"Spatial Comparison"** in your interview.

When discussing this project, say:
> "Even though this was a sales dataset, I focused on the **spatial variance** between the three store locations. I found that the customer product preference in Astoria was completely different from Lower Manhattan, proving that a 'one-size-fits-all' marketing strategy doesn't work geographically."

This makes you sound like a pro who thinks about **Location Strategy**.
